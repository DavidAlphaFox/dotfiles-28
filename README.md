# VHS dotfiles

My little AwesomeWM configuration. Riddled with copyright law breaches. The main attraction is probably my DBus global menu (`appmenu/`). I refuse to document anything but if you want to steal any of my code, go ahead. 

## Stolen Code Appreciation Time

"Whenever Possible, Steal Code" - I stole 95% of this project as any good programmer would
 - `widgets/exit_menu.lua` is lifted from [manilarome/the-glorious-dotfiles](https://github.com/manilarome/the-glorious-dotfiles)
 - `widgets/components/client_preview.lua` is improved from this [Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/awesomewm/comments/akiqz2/)
 - `client/restore.lua` is modified from this [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/awesomewm/comments/cn02m6/)
 - `util/redshift.lua` is modified from [troglobit/awesome-redshift](https://github.com/troglobit/awesome-redshift)
 - `appmenu/server` wouldn't have been possible without [fbuihuu/samples-dbus](https://github.com/fbuihuu/samples-dbus/blob/master/dbus-client.c)
 - All the icons are stolen from ionicons - I plan to do this in a legal matter soonâ„¢
